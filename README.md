# terraform-modules

Module folder name must be in the format of `<provider name>_<list of what its building>`

i.e. s3 bucket from AWS would be `aws_s3`

Must use `_` so when editing its easy to select whole name.

Every module must have readme and change log

Every module must be generic and not TTG specific.
